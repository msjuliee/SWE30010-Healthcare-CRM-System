Day 6:
The Login page is susceptible to Tautology-based SQL Injection attack, after penetration testing done by the red team, we concluded that the input field can be used to manipulate the query’s conditional statement. 
For example, if a user submits the username “luandang” and the password “Swinburne” in the login page, the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:
SELECT * FROM users where username = ‘luandang’ AND password = ‘Swinburne'
An attacker can insert an SQL comment sequence `--` to remove the password checking and manipulate this logic making our statement as follows:
SELECT * FROM users where username = 'administrator'
As this is a serious vulnerability, our team requires that the development team implement input validation for the registration and log in page to prevent sensitive characters from being injected into the backend. 
Our team will also perform additional testing on the rest of this item to ensure that this does not happen on other components.
